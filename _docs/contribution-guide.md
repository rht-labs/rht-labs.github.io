Contribution Guide
======================

> We use the popular [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for collaborating on this repo.

GitHub is designed around a particular collaboration workflow, centered on Pull Requests.
This flow works whether you’re collaborating with a tightly-knit team in a single shared repository, or a globally-distributed company or network of strangers contributing to a project through dozens of forks. It is centered on the Topic Branches workflow covered in Git Branching.

Here’s how it generally works:

1. Start by creating a Fork from the project.
2. Create a topic branch from master.
3. Make some commits to improve the project.
4. Push this branch to your GitHub project.
5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
6. Discuss, and optionally continue committing.
7. The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.
8. Sync the updated master back to your fork.

This is basically the Integration Manager workflow, but instead of using email to communicate and review changes, teams use GitHub’s web based tools.
