How We Work
===========

Team First
--------------------------

We believe the team is the engine driving better outcomes.  We aim to foster long-lived teams of people committed to each other, and able to work together in psychological safety.

We believe teams are most effective when they are empowered to focus on delivering tangible value for real people, and involved in the decision making of what to build, and why to build it, not just how to build it, by when.
