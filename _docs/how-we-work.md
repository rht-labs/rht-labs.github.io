How We Work
===========

Team First
--------------------------

We believe the team is the engine driving better outcomes.  We aim to foster long-lived teams of people committed to each other, and able to work together in psychological safety.

We believe teams are most effective when they are empowered to focus on delivering tangible value for real people, and involved in the decision making of what to build, and why to build it, not just how to build it, by when.

> Take a team first approach to the work and [Start with "Why?"](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-with-why/). 

Open Practice Library
--------------------------

We both draw inspiration from, and contribute to the [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com). 
> The Open Practice Library is an open source, community-driven inspired library of best practices and tools. It helps individuals, teams and entire businesses figure out the optimal ways to get to the best outcome.
